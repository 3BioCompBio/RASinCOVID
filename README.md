In the file COVIDMODELING_FINAL.nb we present the model used in "Modeling the molecular impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on the renin-angiotensin system" https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02772 in order to study how SARS-CoV-2 infection impact on RAS.

**Abstract**
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection is mediated by the binding of its spike protein tothe angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which plays a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin  system  (RAS).  The  study  of  RAS  dysregulation  due  to  SARS-CoV-2  in-fection is fundamentally important for a better understanding of the pathogenic mech-anisms and risk factors associated with COVID-19 coronavirus disease, and to designeffective therapeutic strategies.  In this context, we developed a mathematical model ofRAS based on data regarding protein and peptide concentrations; the model was testedon clinical data from healthy normotensive and hypertensive individuals.  We then usedour model to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RAS, which we modeledthrough  a  down-regulation  of  ACE2  as  a  function  of  viral  load.   We  also  used  it  topredict the effect of RAS-targeting drugs,  such as RAS-blockers,  human recombinantACE2,  and  angiotensin  1-7  peptide,  on  COVID-19  patients;  the  model  predicted  animprovement of the clinical outcome for some drugs and a worsening for others.
