In the Mathematica file COVIDMODELING_FINAL.nb, we present the dynamical model used in "Modeling the molecular impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the renin-angiotensin system" https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02772.

**Abstract**. SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection is mediated by the binding of its spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which plays a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin  system  (RAS). The study of  RAS  dysregulation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is fundamentally important for a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and risk factors associated with COVID-19 coronavirus disease, and to design effective therapeutic strategies. In this context, we developed a mathematical model of RAS based on data regarding protein and peptide concentrations; the model was tested on clinical data from healthy normotensive and hypertensive individuals.  We then used our model to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RAS, which we modeled through a down-regulation  of  ACE2  as  a  function  of  viral  load.   We  also  used  it  to predict the effect of RAS-targeting drugs,  such as RAS-blockers,  human recombinant ACE2,  and  angiotensin  1-7  peptide,  on  COVID-19  patients;  the  model  predicted  an improvement of the clinical outcome for some drugs and a worsening for others.
